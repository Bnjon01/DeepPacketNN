# DeepPacketNN
Implementation and report on the Deep Packet kit by Lotfollahi et al. (2019)

This project is a Neural Network implementation and report on a network forensics/analytics solution for classifying encrypted traffic. The project consists of two scripts and one pdf report, with all information and background being found in the latter file.

Note: The Deep Packet Neural Network system was NOT created by me and is simply my implementation of the original white paper's description of such.
